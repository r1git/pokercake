# Pokercake

An old (written in 2007) poker score database  management system based on the CakePHP framework.
This code is not maintained anymore and certainly an insecure code.
Use at your own risk.

Ported to CakePHP 1.3 (because that's the default install in Ubuntu in Feb 2017).
To install on a remote host, add cake 1.3 directory (usually under /usr/share/php/cake).
